# Plugin Development Guidelines

## Motivation

In opposite to the original [draft-js-plugins](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins) principle of complete plugin separation and independency, the `wix-rich-content` project is created with an intention to provide a solid yet flexible foundation that helps to extend the editor functionality. On other hand, it means that a plugin should be developed in a certain way.

## Source Code

Basically, there is no limitation on plugin source code hosting. At the moment, there are two main GitHub repositories:

- [wix-incubator/rich-content](https://github.com/wix-incubator/rich-content) is a to-be open-source repository that hosts the editor, viewer, and majority of the plugins
- [wix-incubator/rich-content-plugins-wix](https://github.com/wix-incubator/rich-content-plugins-wix) is a repository that hosts plugins dependent on proprietary Wix code
