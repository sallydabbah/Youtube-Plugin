# RichContent Examples

To run these examples, do the following:

- Make sure the `rich-content` modules are [built](https://github.com/wix-incubator/rich-content/blob/master/README.md#run-locally).
- run `yarn` inside the example's directory. (We use yarn to install since it works better than npm with `file://` dependencies)
- run `npm start` inside the example's directory.
